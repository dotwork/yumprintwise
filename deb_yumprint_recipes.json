          "Give a little inspiration to your friends this New Year's Eve with cookies filled with happy messages, good wishes, and resolutions. Perfect for the holidays, they're also a fun bridal shower or party favor - just change the messages to reflect the occasion. From Alyssa Noui, POPSUGAR Food Pirouette New Year's Cookies Notes The cookies begin to cool and harden right away so begin with 4 until you get fast enough to add one more. Then you can alternate sheet pans every 2-3 minutes. Start with the brownest ones first they will harden the fastest. You will not be moving away from your oven so have all utensils at hand. Ingredients1 cup (16 tablespoons) butter, at room temperature 1 cup sugar 4 egg whites 1 teaspoon vanilla 1 cup flour 40-50 1-by-2 1/2-inch paper strips 40-50 6-inch-square foil wrappesr or wax paper Ribbon Directions Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F. Cream the butter, sugar, egg whites, and vanilla until light and fluffy. Slowly add the flour and mix until just blended. Half cup at a time, place the dough into a tempered glass measuring cup and microwave for 15 seconds until pourable. Trace 4-5 3-inch diameter circles on one side of parchment paper. Place paper ink-side down on a half sheet pan. Spoon 1-1 1/2 teaspoons of the batter over a circle template and use the back of the spoon to smooth it into a thin, round layer within in the circle, similar to a crepe. (Thinner is better than too thick; you can tell it\u2019s too thin if you can see the baking sheet through the batter.) Have a cooling rack, offset spatula, and wooden spoon available. Bake for 4-6 minutes. At the first sign of browning around the edges remove the pan. Working quickly, use the offset to lift the soft cookie on to the wooden spoon. Carefully using your fingers - it will be hot - roll the cookie around the spoon handle, pressing the edge into the seam. Place seam side down on rack. Once the cookies are cool, roll paper strips with New Year's resolution messages into a tight roll and insert into the cookie. Roll the cookie in foil, twist sides, and tie with ribbon.

Add butter and pulse until the butter is pea-size and the mixture looks like coarse sand, 6 to 8 times. Add water and beaten egg and pulse until the dough starts to come together into a ball. Turn the mixture out onto a lightly floured work surface and pat it into an oval disk. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for 1 hour. Meanwhile, prepare sauce: Pulse cilantro, jalape\u00f1o and 2 garlic cloves in a mini food processor until finely chopped, scraping down the sides once or twice. Transfer to a small bowl. Add egg yolk and 2 teaspoons lime juice to the mini food processor and pulse until smooth. With the motor running, add \u00bd cup oil in a thin, steady stream and process until creamy. Add the cilantro mixture, the remaining 2 teaspoons lime juice and \u00bd teaspoon salt and pulse until well combined. Set aside. To prepare filling: Heat oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add onion, garlic and \u00bc teaspoon salt. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is soft and lightly browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Add tomato paste and cumin; cook, stirring frequently, for 1 minute. Add chicken and broth; cook, stirring and breaking up the chicken slightly, until the broth has almost completely evaporated but the mixture still looks moist, 3 to 5 minutes. Season with the remaining \u00bd teaspoon salt. Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F. Coat a large baking sheet with cooking spray. Divide the dough into 8 equal portions on a floured work surface. Form each into a ball and roll out into a 6-inch circle. Scoop \u00bc cup of the filling onto the center and sprinkle with 1 generous tablespoon egg. Fold in half, firmly press the edges together to seal and crimp with a fork. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet. Brush with butter. Bake the empanadas until light golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool slightly. Serve warm or at room temperature with the reserved sauce.",
          "To make ahead: Refrigerate dough, sauce and filling separately for up to 3 days. Let dough stand at room temperature for 10 minutes before rolling."

          "Put a piece of parchment paper on your baking pan, preheat your oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit.",
          "Oil your hands and start patting the dough out as thin as you can. If it's easier (and sometimes it does work better) lay the parchment paper on the table, and use a rolling pin to roll your dough out as thin as possible. This will create a more uniform dough ( a little less \"home made\" looking, but bakes more evenly) and will allow you to square up your dough a little better.",
          "Then, using a pizza cutter, or a ravioli wheel (makes a nice design on the cracker edges), or even a sharp paring knife, cut your dough into squares or rectangles. I ground some fresh black pepper and sea salt onto the tops of them (there is enough oil from your hands to hold this on). Then carefully pick up your parchment paper by the edges and lift it back onto the baking pan. Depending on the size of your baking pan, you may need to divide your dough in half and do it in 2 batches.",
          "Bake these little beauties at 375 degrees for about 15 minutes (or longer). Ovens vary, and sloppy cooks like me mess up baking times, because I put in a little too much water or oil, or basically change recipes because I think something sounds good, so I toss it in. So really, just watch it after 15 minutes, and when the crackers are all golden brown and crispy looking, take them out. Cool on racks, and they will crisp up even more as they cool.",
          "These crackers are great for appetizers, with toppings. Even something as simple as a small piece of cheese. Or peanut butter. Or - hummus. When I did a workshop recently and brought these crackers, I made a batch of home made hummus to put on them. Everyone raved. In the event you think hummus is only something you buy at the deli...let me help you. Here is my favorite simple hummus recipe, made with canned chickpeas (that I buy by the case for my pantry. I keep them on hand because they are soooo nutritious.)"

Place the chicken and its feet back in the pot.",

          "Add the ginger, cilantro stems, shallots, and root tips of the green onions to the stock pot with the chicken, and then drop in the coriander, star anise and cloves. Pour enough water into the stock pot to cover the chicken by two inches. Bring the contents of the pot to a boil over high-heat, and then immediately turn down the heat to medium-low. Simmer for thirty minutes, and then remove the chicken from the pot. Cut the chicken breasts from the bone, slice them thinly and set them in an airtight-container in the fridge. Return the chicken to the pot, and continue simmering it a further 2 hours. Strain the broth, discarding the solids. Wipe out the stockpot, and pour the strained broth back into the pot. Keep it warm over low heat while you prepare the other ingredients.",
          "Soak the flat noodles in hot water for 10 minutes. While they soak, bring a pot of hot water to a boil. Plunge the soaked noodles into the boiling water about 20 to 30 seconds, until tender, and then drain them. Chop the dark green parts of the green onion very thinly.",
          "Arrange the noodles, sliced chicken breast, sliced green onions and sliced white onion in your bowls.",
          "Arrange the sliced jalapeno, mung bean sprouts, and remaining herbs on a platter.",

          "Using a premade broth will save time. You can use a traditional, long-simmered premade chicken bone broth (like this one) if you like to save time. Simply simmer the cilantro stems, spices, ginger, shallot and green onions in the broth about 20 minutes before straining and serving."

          "Depending on your supermarket, it might be hard to find a lean option for ground pork. But it's easy to make your own in a food processor. Choose a lean cut, such as loin or tenderloin. Cut into pieces and then pulse in a food processor until uniformly ground (being careful not to overprocess, turning the meat into mush). Or ask your butcher to grind it for you. Using lean pork instead of regular ground pork saves up to 164 calories and 5 grams of saturated fat per 3 ounces of cooked meat."

        "method": [
          "Small handfuls fresh mint leaves, roughly chopped Combine all of the prepared vegetables (leaving out the herbs) in a large bowl. Remove the chicken from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature while you make the rest of the salad. To make the dressing, whisk together the lime juice, garlic, rice wine vinegar, Sriracha, brown sugar, fish sauce, sesame oil, walnut oil and \u00bd teaspoon sea salt. Taste and add more salt if you like. Set aside. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Toss the vegetables with a couple pinches of sea salt. When the water is boiling, break the noodles in half and drop them into the pot. Cook the noodles according to the package directions, until they\u2019re tender but still have a little bite. Drain the noodles and run them under cold water for a minute or two to cool them and keep them from getting gummy. Drain them again and add to the bowl with the vegetables. Heat a grill or a grill pan to medium heat. Remove the chicken thighs from the marinade and sprinkle each lightly with salt on all sides. Start the thighs fat-side down on the grill, cooking for 7 minutes, until the fat is crisp and charred. Flip the thighs and cook for another 5 to 7 minutes (slice into one with a sharp knife to check that there isn't any pink remaining). Once the chicken is cooked, remove it from the grill and set it aside to cool for about 5 minutes. When the thighs are cool enough to handle, cut the meat off the bones and then slice it crosswise, so that each slice includes a little strip of charred, crispy fat. Toss the vegetables and noodles with about two thirds of the dressing, and taste a noodle. Add more dressing if you like. Fold in the chicken and the herbs and serve. If you want to make this ahead of time, or if you end up with leftovers in the fridge, I recommend warming the salad gently before serving (cold rice noodles can get quite stiff). You can either warm the salad for 30 to 45 seconds in the microwave, or put it in a large saut\u00e9 pan over medium low heat, tossing frequently, until it starts to loosen and warm, about 5 minutes."

Taste: if it's too pungent, add more water, 1 tablespoon at a time. If you'd like more sweetness, add more brown sugar, 1/2 tablespoon at a time. Remember that you're going to be putting this dressing on unsalted vegetables and noodles: you want the dressing to have a lot of flavor, but it shouldn't knock you over. Pour into a serving bowl. (Covered and chilled, the dressing will keep for 3 days to a week.) Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the rice noodles, and cook for 4 to 5 minutes, until tender but not mushy. Immediately drain the noodles into a colander, and rinse them well with cold water. Lay out a clean kitchen towel on the countertop, shake the colander to drain away excess water, and then spread the cooked noodles on the towel to drain further. Divide the noodles between two or three good-sized bowls, depending on the number of diners, and top with the vegetables, herbs, and meat. Scatter the peanuts on top. Allow each person to spoon on dressing to taste. Toss well, and eat. (Alternatively, you can present this salad family-style: Toss the vegetables, herbs, and noodles in a mixing bowl and then mound them on a serving platter. Arrange the meat over the noodles, and top with peanuts. Each diner can scoop their own portion from the platter and dress it as they see fit.)"

(The batter will be thin.) Place bowl in the refrigerator and let rest for 30 minutes. Once rested, the batter should be just slightly thicker than heavy cream (which means it will be slightly thicker than regular crepe batter). Add a tablespoon or two of water if needed. Heat a nonstick skillet or crepe pan on medium heat. Spray with nonstick spray just before pouring in the batter each time. Pour in just under 1/4 cup of batter into the hot, greased pan, and swirl the pan around to coat the entire bottom of the pan with the batter, using the back of spoon if needed to help it spread quickly. After the swirling, place the pan back on the burner and let it cook for about 30-60 seconds, or until the top of the crepe looks partially dry. Then pull the crepe off the burner for another 30-60 seconds (I cook on the back burner and pull to the front burner.). This off-burner cooking trick is what makes my GF crepes perfect \u2014 totally worth the extra seconds of cook time. The extra (low-heat) time let the crepes settle into shape, so they flipped easily without falling apart, while not over-browning them. As the crepes cook, stack them on a large plate. Then fill with anything you want, from ham and cheese to chocolate-hazelnut spread. Fold and enjoy."

A long loaf shrinks in length even more when it becomes a ficelle, which is only a foot long and about 2 inches wide. Round shapes are just as numerous.

Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, add flour and mix vigorously with a wooden spoon to form a smooth dough. Cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. The dough should dry out slightly and pull away from the pan. Scrape the dough into a medium bowl and let cool for 2 minutes. Using a wooden spoon, beat eggs one at a time into the dough, beating thoroughly after each addition. The batter will separate after each egg, but keep stirring: it will come back together. Add cheese, mustard, thyme and rosemary and fold to combine. Transfer the dough to a pastry bag fitted with a round \u215c- to \u00be-inch pastry tip (or use a gallon-size plastic bag with about \u00be inch snipped off a corner). Pipe 25 small mounds of dough onto each prepared baking sheet, making each a littler wider than a quarter. Bake, rotating the pans front to back and top to bottom halfway through, until puffed and golden, 18 to 20 minutes. Serve warm."

          "III. \u00a0Once your dough has formed a mass you can switch to the dough hook and mix on medium speed for about two minutes. \u00a0Or if you are doing it by hand you can continue mixing with a wooden spoon for about 5 minutes, occasionally putting the spoon in the middle of the dough and mixing from there. \u00a0If the dough is too sticky or dry feel free to add water or flour by the tablespoon. \u00a0After it has mixed let it rest for about 5 minutes.",
          "IV. \u00a0Add in your chopped sage and then let the dough mix for another 3 minutes, or another 5 minutes of hand mixing. \u00a0Place the dough on the counter and, using the flour reserved on the counter, knead the dough by hand. \u00a0If the dough already feels soft and firm you may only need to knead for a couple of minutes.",
          "Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, turning the dough over to coat the whole thing in oil. \u00a0Cover with a kitchen towel and place to rest in a warm spot for an hour and a half. \u00a0The dough should double in size. \u00a0Remove the dough from the bowl and then lightly punch the dough down and then reform it into a ball. \u00a0Return to bowl and allow to rest for another 30 minutes.",
          "VI. \u00a0After the second short rest place the dough on a lightly floured surface and cut into two pieces. \u00a0Form each piece into a round ball, tucking any haggard edges underneath the dough. \u00a0Cover with a damp cloth and then let rest for 45 minutes to an hour.",
          "VII. \u00a0During the last 20 minutes of the resting period preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit. \u00a0Leave a baking sheet or stone to heat in the oven as well.",
          "VIII. \u00a0Right before the boules go in the oven slash the tops with a very sharp knife or a razor blade if you have it with 2 - 4 slashes. \u00a0I did squares, but x's or any design you'd like would work! \u00a0Carefully transfer the dough to the baking sheets and return to the oven.",
          "IX. \u00a0If you want a bit of caramel coloring on the crust of your bread - create steam in the oven! \u00a0You can pour about 1/4 cup of water on the bottom of the oven or take a water filled spray bottle and spray around the edges of the oven. \u00a0Wait 2 minutes and then repeat the process.",
          "Bake the loaves for 25-30 minutes. \u00a0They'll be golden and beautiful. \u00a0Let cool and then enjoy with honey or jam!"

          "Many thanks to Erika for the comprehensive instructions and to all who commented! Here are a few more tips, courtesy of Hodgson Mill. You can prepare the bread using either a 1 1/2 lb bread machine or a 9x5x3 bread pan, greased and dusted with cornstarch. If your bread machine does not have a gluten free cycle, your bread will not rise as high as it otherwise would. Heat the milk to 110 degrees and have all other ingredients at room temperature, so you may need to warm the eggs in a bowl of warm water. If you are using small eggs, use only two and add extra whites to equal 2/3 cup altogether. After you mix ingredients and place the thick batter in the pan, be sure to smooth the top with a wet spatula. After the short rise in the pan (25 to 30 minutes, or until dough reaches the top of the pan) bake in a preheated 375 degree oven for 60 to 65 minutes, but after the first ten minutes, cover with a double layer of foil, sealing the edges around the bread pan. After removing the bread from the oven (be sure to first check internal temperature, as Erika suggests!) turn the loaf out onto a wire rack. You should wait until it is completely cool before slicing. Refrigerate cooled loaves to preserve freshness. In lieu of rice flour, the Hodgson Mill mix contains garbanzo-fava flour and sorghum flour along with corn starch, tapioca starch and rice starch. Other ingredients that are not Erika\u2019s recipe are soy lecithin and ascorbic acid, and the recipe does not call for baking powder."

          "Bake for 45 minutes at 425 degrees F. Then remove lid and bake another 15 minutes uncovered to further brown the top crust.Remove from oven and check internal temperature of the bread with an instant-read thermometer if you have one. It should read at least 205+ degrees F. This indicates that the bread is thoroughly baked.",
          "Let sit for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, carefully grasp the parchment paper again and transfer your bread to a cooling rack. You may remove the parchment paper now so the bread can cool. Please note that the bread is still cooking and the crumb is setting up at this point\u2013let it cool completely before you slice it. It\u2019s hard to wait, but you will be happy you did!",
          "This bread stores best on the counter, unwrapped at room temperature (not in the fridge). Do not wrap it in foil or plastic wrap\u2013it will make the crust gummy. \u00a0Once you cut it, store it unwrapped with the cut side down on the cutting board at room temperature. \u00a0If you really want to wrap it, use a paper bag or something like\u00a0Debbie Meyer Bread Bags\u2013which are porous like paper bags and they let the bread breathe. \u00a0My local food co-op carries them."

To make maple glaze: Combine confectioners' sugar and vanilla in a bowl. Gradually whisk in enough maple syrup to make a coating consistency. Dip the shaped side (underside) of the \"doughnuts\" in the glaze to coat. Then set them, glazed-side up on a rack over wax paper for a few minutes until the glaze has set."

Fold the two opposite sides of the tortilla in so that they meet and overlap, then fold in the two remaining open ends so that the entire burrito is sealed. Wrap it tightly in plastic wrap so that the entire burrito is very tightly sealed. (I find it easiest to fold the plastic wrap over the two short ends, then the longer sides of the burrito.) Then transfer burritos to the freezer, where they will last for up to 3 months.",

You can even make it a hot cereal for cold winter mornings by either heating the milk or sticking the bowl of granola, milk and all into your microwave (if you have one)for under a minute. It makes a great snack, right out of the jar. This is economical, healthy and good. Even my hardworking Irishman can only eat about a cup of it for breakfast, with rice milk. That is too much for me.

Try it in place of a portion of other flour in recipes like pancakes, quick breads and muffins. Look for it with other whole-grain flours or near gluten-free flours. Or make your own, grind old-fashioned rolled oats in a blender or food processor until they are the texture of flour."

You don't need to add sweetener at all though\u2014I often just add a bit of vanilla and cinnamon without any sugar and then eat it with fresh fruit on top. A small squeeze of lemon juice can help give your overnight oats a nice little tang, and balance out the sweetness. Stir it all together, taste, and adjust the flavoring until it's right where you want it."

        "method": [
          "Position racks in upper and lower third of oven; preheat to 425\u00b0F. Toss potatoes with 1 tablespoon oil in a large bowl until well coated. Divide between 2 large baking sheets and spread in an even layer. Roast, rotating the pans from top to bottom about halfway through, until tender and beginning to brown, about 20 to 25 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion; cook, stirring frequently, until very soft and golden brown, 5 to 8 minutes. Add garlic; cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute more. Add, flour, salt and pepper; cook, stirring for 1 minute more. Add milk; cook, stirring and scraping up any brown bits at the bottom of the pan. Increase heat to medium high; cook, stirring, until the sauce thickens and bubbles, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Squeeze spinach to remove any excess moisture; stir into the sauce. When the potatoes are done, remove them from the oven. Preheat the broiler. Transfer half the potatoes to a 2-quart broiler-safe baking dish. Spread half the sauce over the potatoes and top with \u00bd cup cheese. Add the remaining potatoes and top with the remaining sauce and cheese. Broil, watching carefully, until the sauce is bubbling and the cheese is beginning to brown, 1 to 5 minutes, depending on your broiler. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.",
          "To make ahead: Roast potatoes (Step 2) up to 30 minutes ahead. Prepare sauce (Step 3), cover and refrigerate for up to 1 day; gently reheat until steaming before combining with the potatoes and cheese."

Let the batter sit, without stirring, for 10 to 15 minutes. (As the batter rests, the baking powder forms bubbles that create fluffy pancakes.) Coat a large nonstick skillet or griddle with cooking spray; heat over medium heat. Without stirring the batter, measure out pancakes using about \u00bc cup batter per pancake and pour into the pan (or onto the griddle). Cook until the edges are dry and you see bubbles on the surface, 2 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until golden brown on the other side, 2 to 4 minutes more. Repeat with the remaining batter, coating the pan with cooking spray and reducing the heat as needed.",
          "Make-Ahead Tip: The mixture of dry ingredients can be stored airtight for up to 1 month; the batter can be refrigerated for up to 1 day; cooked pancakes can be frozen airtight, in a single layer, for up to 3 months. Reheat in the microwave or oven.",
