Here are a few more tips, courtesy of Hodgson Mill. You can prepare the bread using either a 1 1/2 lb bread machine or a 9x5x3 bread pan, greased and dusted with cornstarch. If your bread machine does not have a gluten free cycle, your bread will not rise as high as it otherwise would. Heat the milk to 110 degrees and have all other ingredients at room temperature, so you may need to warm the eggs in a bowl of warm water. If you are using small eggs, use only two and add extra whites to equal 2/3 cup altogether. After you mix ingredients and place the thick batter in the pan, be sure to smooth the top with a wet spatula. After the short rise in the pan (25 to 30 minutes, or until dough reaches the top of the pan) bake in a preheated 375 degree oven for 60 to 65 minutes, but after the first ten minutes, cover with a double layer of foil, sealing the edges around the bread pan. After removing the bread from the oven (be sure to first check internal temperature, as Erika suggests!) turn the loaf out onto a wire rack. You should wait until it is completely cool before slicing. Refrigerate cooled loaves to preserve freshness. In lieu of rice flour, the Hodgson Mill mix contains garbanzo-fava flour and sorghum flour along with corn starch, tapioca starch and rice starch. Other ingredients that are not Erika\u2019s recipe are soy lecithin and ascorbic acid, and the recipe does not call for baking powder."]}, {"id": "v-nS", "title": "Sourdough Bread\u00a0(", "image": "https://images.yumprint.com/p1yumprintob/ObncdFWRH3zFRdHf5RPxkbXkA8uWDcFf-B9_KQCgEN8o42NGyUb-iS_AJb2F2Y2i", "link": "http://www.artofglutenfreebaking.com/2010/10/sourdough-bread-boule-gluten-free/", "ingredients": ["Special Equipment Needed", "-4 quart/3.8 liter Dutch oven w/a lid: Lodge, Le Creuset, Mario Batali, Martha Stewart, Dansk are all good brands", "-a 4 quart/3.8 liter bowl (one the same size as your Dutch oven)", "-heavy-duty stand mixer (this will work best, but a hand mixer will do in a pinch)", "-parchment paper and plastic wrap", "-spray bottle with water for spraying top of the crust", "-instant read thermometer is nice to double-check the interior temperature of finished bread, but you can do without it (they are cheap\u2013get one!)30 oz/850 g (a bit less than 4 cups) sourdough starter (200% BP)", "15 oz/425 g (about 3 cups) mix of gluten-free flours", "\u2013>I like a combo of equal parts sorghum, brown rice, and tapioca. \u00a0I have found that the bread works best with a mixture of 2 cups whole grain flours (I like sorghum and brown rice) and 1 cup tapioca flour. \u00a0It seems to work best if tapioca is one of the flours used\u2013it\u2019s a starch and it helps the bread be less dense than it already is.
